- Compare data formats (XML, JSON, and YAML)

Human readable, computer readable.

- Computers need structure.
- annotated for humans.
- open and extensible.
- self describing.
- platform agnostic / lifespan.

- plain text ascii formats

XML -   uses tags,  legacy support, has been around for a while. Format for SOAP.  Very verbose (con, large file sizes)
        prolog is optional,   root tag
        tag can contain attributes. <tag id="2"> (single or double quotes)
        Can contain other tags.
        Elements can contain sub-elements in its values, empty elements <empty/> or <empty id='2'/> 
        Esc values inside qoutes &apos; &quot;
        DOM, document object model. (XML tools in VScode) , tree view structure. Makes the largers files easier to read.


JSON -  doensnt care about whitespace, indents or new line. popular, lightweight, native to JS. 
        defacto standard, serializing data into it.
        key:value pairs.
        [] array, needs commar seperation, doesnt need a key. indexed 0 1 2 etc.
        {} objects, inside object needs k:v, needs a commar seperation, can nest
        key needs "" double quotes. Values dont.
        Keys = number, "str" or boolen(lower case).



YAML -  cares about indents.  Highly legable, compact/succinct, ideal for configurations.
        --- denotes a YAML file, end ... can have multiple documents in one file.
        more human readable.
        indentation matters, needs to be consistant in a collection.
        K:V pairs
        # for comments.
        Values = number, float (decimal point), strings dont need quotes litiral but they can have them if you want new line etc.
        boolen = lower case or first letter upper case, true or True.
